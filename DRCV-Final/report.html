<h1>Results</h1>
<p>1. This website is built for a Chippewa Valley run business called Disaster Ready Chippewa Valley</p>
<p>2. We have a header showing the title of each page.</p>
<p>3. We have 10 pages: Home (Dashboard), About Us, Contact Us, Continuity Resources, DRCV Membership, Email List (Page), Key Websites, Past Events, Upcomming Events and Work Place Violence.</p>
<p>4. Each page has navigation links to other pages and other urls. This is also the case for pictures.</p>
<p>5. For each of our pages, they have responsive design when compressed to a smaller size. For example, when our Home page gets smaller, the boxes shift from 4 in a line to rows of 2.</p>
<p>6. Each of our pages have the same coloring and style (layout). Pages that contain boxes are responsive and have a color outline when hovered over. Are global file is the NavbarStyle.css.</p>
<p>7. Each of our images in the source code contain alt attributes giving a small description of what they are.</p>
<p>8. Each page declares its favicon (Look at this source code to see what we used!): <!--<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="images/drcvlogo.jpg">--></p>
<p>9. Our images are placed in a images folder and our css code is placed in a CSS folder with correct navigation links.</p>
<p>10. We did not implement any Bootstrap Framework, JQuery, React, etc. in our website (We grabbed some images from Bootstrap).</p>
<p>11. We did not see any large erros in the validators besides parse erros and aria-labels which don't affect the website.</p> 
<p>12. Our code is located in a Github repository named DRCV. All updates and changes to the website are finalized through the repository. It is also shared with gomesr-uwec.</p>
<p>13. All is in lowercase</p>
<p>14. Each page has neatly alligned content with correct axes.</p> 
<p>15. On each page, we have a variety of font faces; bolded, sans-serif, and Geneva.</p>
<p>16. The site includes links to external sites on our Key Websites Page. E.g. We used the target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer".</p>
<p>17. Our source code is very readable, contains memorable class names, and is organized.</p> 
<p>18. Our navbar is easy to navigate, responsive to browser change, and is present on each page.</p> 
<p>19. We have a footer with all of our names, the contact for the business, and a "report an issue on Git" option. This footer is also on each page, readable, and has responsive design when the browser is smaller.</p>
<p>20. Each page incorporates a Grid responsive design.</p> 
<p>We have templates in place so that if the business were to add or change things in the future, they can do so with ease.</p>
