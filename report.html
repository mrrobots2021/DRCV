<h1>Results</h1>
<p>1. This website is built for a Chippewa Valley run business called Disaster Ready Chippewa Valley</p>
<p>2. We have a header showing the title of each page.</p>
<p>3. We have 10 pages: Home (Dashboard), About Us, Contact Us, Continuity Resources, DRCV Membership, Email List (Page), Key Websites, Past Events, Upcoming Events and Work Place Violence.</p>
<p>4. Each page has navigation links to other pages and other urls. This is also the case for some pictures.</p>
<p>5. For each of our pages, they have responsive design when compressed to a smaller size. For example, when our Home page gets smaller, the boxes shift from 4 in a line to rows of 2.</p>
<p>6. Each of our pages have the same coloring and style (layout). Pages that contain boxes are responsive and have a color outline when hovered over. Are global file is the NavbarStyle.css.</p>
<p>7. Each of our images in the source code contain alt attributes giving a small description of what they are.</p>
<p>8. Each page declares its favicon (Look at this source code to see what we used!): <!--<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="images/drcvlogo.jpg">--></p>
<p>9. Our images are placed in a images folder and our css code is placed in a CSS folder with correct navigation links. We did not create a directory for js only because there was one file.</p>
<p>10. We did not implement any Bootstrap Framework, JQuery, React, etc. in our website (We grabbed some icons from Bootstrap).</p>
<p>11. All of the files are lowercase.</p>
<p>12. Each page has neatly alligned content with correct axes.</p> 
<p>13. On each page, we have a variety of font faces; bolded, sans-serif, and Geneva.</p>
<p>14. Any type of login for are site has some type of GET/POST request. Also for our contact us page, we have a form that will send to an admin email.</p>
<p>15. The site includes links to external sites on our Key Websites Page. E.g. We used the target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer".</p>
<p>16. Our source code is very readable, contains memorable class names, and is organized.</p> 
<p>17. On our homepage, we have our logo that eventually changes into a slogan through CSS.</p>
<p>18. Our site is connected to a mysql database through hostgator which is how members logins are stored.</p>
<p>19. We have the option to log in as a member or an administrator. As an admin, there are baseline options to remove users as well as add them.</p>
<p>20. We addressed the feedback from earlier this semester in class by changing our navbar to look a bit nicer as well as have better functionality. We added a hamburger option when the browser gets smaller just so the navbar doesn't take up a lot of space. We also addressed the hover over font on the homepage so it was more readable. We addressed the styling issues with the about us page by making each image the same size so they do not cut off. Also within the about us page, we made sure that each member box was the same size as well.</p>
<p>We have templates in place so that if the business were to add or change things in the future, they can do so with some ease.</p>
